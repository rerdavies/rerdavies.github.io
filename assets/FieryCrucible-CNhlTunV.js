One of the infuriating problems with that section of the documentation was that I was unable to come up with an actual concrete example of a circular shared pointer reference that would occur in normal use of the NWindows APIs. It's a fairly technical problem, and in practice, a simple problem to avoid. Generally, the solution is to convert shared pointers to weak pointers if they are going to have any significant lifetime (for example, as lambda capture variables). Or to obtain a reference to the object you're interested in for one of ",e.jsx(t,{children:"source"})," argument of the event handler. So, in search of an un-contrived example, I spent some time reviewing the design of event handlers in NWindows. And while doing so, I noticed that even in cases where users of the library are doing things they should not, I could cut off most circular references, even deliberately inflicted circular references by having windows release references to their visual tree when they are closed. A trivial code change that ends up significantly reduces the risk of leaking memory that arose out of analysis done while writing documentation! So I made the change. The warnings in the documentation remain. But curiously, I am fairly certain that, with the change implemented, circular references never occur in NWindows applications unless the user goes to extraordinary lengths to create them! However, I am only fairly certain, not absolutely certain, so the warning in the documentation remains. And the sample code which illustrates the problem continues to create a circular reference gratuitously for no other reason than to illustrate the potential problem. A number of even APIs were also modified to pass a ",e.jsx(t,{children:"source"})," argument of the correct type, to reduce the temptation for users to capture a shared pointer, incurring a theoretical (but not actual) risk of creating a circular reference chain."]}),e.jsx("p",{children:"In short, writing about the general principles of using the library brought about a review of the general principles that are actually used by the library, and resulted in a number of substantial changes to the code to ensure that general principles were in fact being applied."}),e.jsx("h3",{children:"The Curious Case of the Coding Assistant"}),e.jsx("p",{children:"I used a Coding AI while generating the documentation for NWindows.

This is an experiment, and I'm not sure I wholeheartedly endorse the idea; but it is an interesting idea, nonetheless. The NWindows Index page is modelled on the index page of a book. The principle difference between the Index page and search box results is that entries are sorted differently. In the Index page search results are grouped by index keyword. Sorting of search results, is pretty similar. Although search entries are grouped by keyword in the index page, search box results actually end up being sorted in a very similar way, because search results get a substantial sorting bonus if a search term matches the associated keyword of a potential search result candidate. A significant difference, however is how search results that appear in different sections of the documentation are sorted. When sorting search results, NWindows chooses to give a significant sort order bonus to search results that appear in the API documentation.
