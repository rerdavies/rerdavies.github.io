In my second life, outside of the software development world, I play jazz guitar. And like all guitarists, I am always looking for perfect tone. I have always loved the sound of a Fender Deluxe tube amplifier, but have always hated the inconvenience of a Fender Deluxe tube amplifier — the weight, the fragility, and the fact that they are living breathing things that are not quite predictable, and never quite sound the same way twice. So I have usually played using digital amp simulators, which have all kinds of advantages. But perfect sounds isn't one of them. They never sound quite right. So I, like all guitarists, have always been looking better tone."}),e.jsx("p",{children:"I had some ideas about guitar amp emulations that I wanted to try out, and Reaktor provided a quick (but impractical) way to test those ideas on a live guitar signal. And the results were kind of interesting. So I decided to take it further, and write a native plugin so that I could have a more flexible software platform to work with. I did have experience writing VST plugins for Windows, but the idea of adding a laptop to my guitar rig was not appealing. However, I did happen to have a Raspberry Pi 4 sitting around, waiting to find a purpose.
