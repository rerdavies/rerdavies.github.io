It is pretty much any open source license that does not infect other peoples' source code with its own license terms, like the GPL Libre licenses do. So MIT, BSD, Apache (with some caveats for those who own large patent libraries), Mozilla and many others are Free Like Air and Sunshine. I generally prefer MIT licenses for open-source software that I write myself, because the MIT license is short and uncomplicated;  and it's a standard license whose terms and consequences and risks are relatively well understood; and it has slightly fewer variants than BSD licenses (which are fine FLAS licenses too)."}),e.jsx("p",{children:"The general intent of a Free Like Air and Sunlight license is that it allows anyone to use software for any purpose at all, including commercial purposes. It allows anyone to modify my software, and to distribute it in source or binary form (subject only to the very modest requirements of an MIT license).  And â€”  most importantly of all *â€” it does not require people who use my code to redistribute their code if they do not want to. There are many licenses that meet this criteria, but I generally use the MIT license because of its directness and simplicity."}),e.jsx("p",{children:"And so, in the spirit of Free Like Air and Sunlight, I release all of my open-source projects under a Free Like Air and Sunlight MIT license.

About 160 of them have freedom. So far, the GPL has not affected those numbers one way or another.

Of the 11 devices in my immediate vincinity that can or do run Linux, only four of them are actually user-patchable; and one of those four will immediately and irrevocably lose access to Netflix (and a bunch of other security-related functionality) if its bootloader is ever unlocked; one of them (running Ubuntu 22.04) withholds critical security patches to FOSS software if you don't pay for a license; and a third (a Raspberry Pi device) relies on closed-source device drivers to access pretty much every device on its SBC.
